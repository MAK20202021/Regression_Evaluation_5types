# Regression_Evaluation_5types

This exercise is a combination of different types of Regression models. Dataset is related to the energy output where the features are the ambient temperature, exhaust vacuum, ambient pressure, relative humidity. 
The main objective of the analysis is to focus on the evaluation of five types of regression models such as Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decission Tree and Random Forest Regression model. R2-score is used as the evaluation metrics.

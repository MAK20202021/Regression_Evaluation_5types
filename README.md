# Regression_Evaluation_5types

This exercise is a good sourse of better understanding on content-based and collaborative filtering based recommender systems. At the beginning, I provides the recommendations of the courses based on user profile and course similarity matrix and then user profile clustering. At last, different collaborative filtering models such as KNN, NMF, SVD, NN with embeddings have been developed and evaluated through Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). 
The main objective of the analysis is to focus on the recommender systems to build a better machine learning model to provide the personalized recommendations of the online courses.
